The project is built using Java with Postman for API testing and database management.

The application manages students, teachers, and courses within an educational institution. It handles student
enrollment, assigns instructors to classes, and tracks grades and attendance. The system also generates academic
performance reports for each term.
Postman was essential for testing endpoints like creating student records, updating grades, and retrieving class
information before building the frontend. This approach made debugging efficient and helped me understand API
workflows.
